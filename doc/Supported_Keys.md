# Komplement: Supported keys #
This document contains a reference of all the buttons that can be mapped and 
all the keys that can be mapped to. These strings are used in a mapping 
configuration file. 

This includes "normal" computer keyboard keys but also some MMC keys that
can be be sent via the output ALSA MIDI port that your software can connect
to.

Note the parser for the entries in the mapping file is case-insensitive, so 
these mean the same thing:

## Keyboard buttons ##
These are the buttons on the Komplete Kontrol keyboard itself. The following 
are all supported and can be assigned:

    Shift
    Scale
    Arp
    Undo
    Quantize
    Ideas
    Loop
    Metro
    Tempo
    Play
    Record
    Stop
    Preset Up
    Preset Down
    Mute
    Solo
    Browser
    Plug-In
    Track
    Octave Down
    Octave Up
    4D Up
    4D Right
    4D Left
    4D Down
    4D Button
    4D CW
    4D CCW

> Note that *only* "Shift" can be combined with other buttons, so the following 
> would be valid in your mapping configuration file:
> `Undo=LeftCtrl,Z`
> `Shift+Undo=LeftCtrl,LeftShift,R`

Tapping on the rotary dials can also be mapped if you really want:

    Rotary1
    Rotary2
    Rotary3
    Rotary4
    Rotary5
    Rotary6
    Rotary7
    Rotary8
    
I discovered that the payload does include 6 additional buttons, but these cannot 
be triggered by the Komplete Kontrol A25. I am guessing that Native Instruments use the 
same protocol for different devices, and these might just work on keyboards that
do have more buttons.

    Button35
    Button36
    Button37
    Button38
    Button39


## MMC keys ##
These are the MMC keys that can be mapped to:

	MMC_Play
	MMC_Record_Strobe
	MMC_Record_Pause
	MMC_Record_Exit
	MMC_Forward
	MMC_Rewind

## Keys ##
These is a list of all the "normal" keys that can be mapped to. 

This is quite an extensive list that is based on the defines in the Linux 
header file `/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h`.

There could be some irrelevant keys in here, or some useful keys could be
missing.
